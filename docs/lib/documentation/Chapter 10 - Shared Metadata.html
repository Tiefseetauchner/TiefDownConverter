<h1 id="shared-metadata">Shared Metadata</h1>
<p>Shared metadata is defined once for the whole project and is
available to every markdown project. It lives under
<code>[shared_metadata]</code> in the manifest file and is merged with
project specific metadata at conversion time. Values defined in a
markdown project override entries from the shared metadata.</p>
<p>Use shared metadata for information that stays the same across
multiple books or documents, like the publisher or an overarching author
list.</p>
