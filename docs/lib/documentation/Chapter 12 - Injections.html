<h1 id="injections">Injections</h1>
<p>Injections are a project-driven way to insert input files at either
the top, inside, or bottom of a document, correspondingly named header,
body and footer injections.</p>
<p>Injections serve as a template scoped way to add content to a
conversion. An injection is defined once in the manifest and then
assigned to a template as any of the aforementioned methods.</p>
<p>During conversion, the injected files are resolved and placed in the
list of input files to be converted to the intermediary format.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-footer-injections">Header and footer injections</h2>
<p>Header injections are inserted at the top of the document, while
footer injections are inserted at the bottom, both in the order as
defined in the manifest. The first file defined in the first referenced
injection is placed first, the last file of the last referenced
injection last.</p>
<h2 id="body-injections">Body injections</h2>
<p>Body injections are injected before the main sorting algorithm as any
file in the input directory would be. That means they get sorted in
accordance with the primary sorting algorithm.</p>
