# TiefDown!

Your new best friend!

If you're like me, your only friend!

Haha!

Anyways, TiefDown (and by extension, TiefDownConverter) is a simple, yet
powerful project management extravaganza to convert your markdown files to
whatever you want. It streamlines project management, conversion, template
management, multi-project conversion, and so much more that I ended up
writing a gazillion line documentation for it.

Ah. I was supposed to be writing a landing page with marketing terms...

# Once again - TiefDown, A Flexible Markdown Project Management Solution

TiefDown is a project format to manage your Markdown projects. At it's heart,
it's just a central manifest file that contains the metadata for your project,
and you can do the rest - or let tools like TiefDownConverter do it for you.

Whether you're a developer, a writer, or a student, TiefDown is the perfect
solution for you. It's flexibility rivals no solution I know of, and it's
super easy to get started with.

**TiefDownConverter** is the official CLI tool - but it’s just one way to work
with TiefDown projects.

## Use Cases

Are you writing a dissertation? A book? A blog? A website? A website that's a
book? A website that's a blog? A website that's a book that's a blog? TiefDown
has you covered. Simply write your content in Markdown. Let's look at some of
the top usecases:

- **Writing a book**: TiefDown is the perfect solution for writing a book. You
  can write your book in Markdown, and then use TiefDown to convert it to
  an A4 PDF with a custom LaTeX or typst template, or to an EPUB or even a
  fancy Website!
- **Writing Docs**: TiefDown is the perfect solution for writing documentation.
  Write the docs in Markdown and export to HTML, PDF, or even man pages!
- **Writing a blog**: TiefDown is the perfect solution for writing a blog.
  Well, maybe not perfect. It's no CMS, but if you want a SPA blog, it can do
  that for you. Just write a template and the blog posts, and TiefDown can
  convert it all to an HTML site, or if you want even a PDF! Why...? I don't
  know! But it can!

## Why TiefDown?

Focus on the content, not the conversion! TiefDown is specifically designed
to alleviate the pain of converting your Markdown files to multiple formats.

When you convert, your Markdown files are combined and converted into whatever
format you want. You can then insert that output into your templates, or
convert them however you want with custom processors.
