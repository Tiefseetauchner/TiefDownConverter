<h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>
<p>This project is open source, and I’d love for you to contribute!
There’s a few things you should know before you start.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When raising the version, don’t forget to
change the version in the documentation as well!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h2>
<p>The project has a relatively straight forward conversion process, as
shown in the diagram below.</p>

<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h2>
<p>Pull Requests should be made with either a link to an issue or an
explanation of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What was the problem</li>
<li>How is it solved now</li>
<li>How did it affect the documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>It takes a lot of work to understand the intention of code you didn’t
write and then judging whether this was indeed the intended outcome.
That’s why it’s helpful for everyone if there’s an explanation on what
was changed and why.</p>
<h2 id="conversion">Conversion</h2>
<p>Conversion is split in a few different steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Combine all the markdown files into one megafile called
<code>combined.md</code>.</li>
<li>Run Pandoc conversion to TeX, EPUB, or Typst. This uses Lua filters
that are defined in the <code>manifest.toml</code> file.</li>
<li>Run XeLaTeX on all TeX templates, Typst on all Typst templates, and
so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Say you were to add a new conversion type. In
<code>converters.rs</code>, you’d need to add a new function that
handles the full conversion. Including handling lua filters, markdown
conversion, so on. This converter function has to then be included in
our conversion decision logic in <code>conversion_decider.rs</code>. And
for that you need to add a new TemplateType, which includes editing the
implementations. Then you need to add the new template type decision
logic to <code>get_template_type_from_path</code>.</p>
<h2 id="presets">Presets</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a bit of a niche usecase, so
documentation is lacking. You can always ask for help on this in a
GitHub issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also add new presets, but that’s a bit more involved. You
should check the implementation for the existing presets, I don’t think
it’s useful to document this nieche usecase for now.</p>
<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>Hope you don’t have to change the manifest.toml file. If you do,
change the manifest model, increase the version number in
<code>consts.rs</code> and add a upgrade logic to
<code>manifest_model.rs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>Currently primarily integration tests. See the <code>tests</code>
folder for examples. Any pull request to main will automatically run
tests, and the expectation is that at least the existing tests work. If
they break, fix your code or, if you changed behavior on purpose, the
tests.</p>
<p>I appreciate it if you add test coverage for your changes. I
especially would appreciate more unit tests, but the tests I have are
sufficient for now. Integration tests take priority over unit tests for
me, as the overall behavior is more important to me than the individual
functions, and I only have so much time that I want to spend on this
project.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>When changing the documentation, it is of utmost importance that the
documentation outputs are correctly generated. <em>These are not
automatically generated on release</em> but rather held in git to more
easily track changes during a pull request.</p>
<p>To make sure this documentation is up to date, consider whether your
changes significantly affect the workflow of using TiefDownConverter. If
you add a command or flag, make sure to run
<code>tools/generate_docs.py</code>. Either way, when changing the
documentation, always run <code>tiefdownconverter convert -p docs</code>
before committing the changes.</p>
<p>Praise be you don’t need to have any fonts installed anymore - they
are packaged in the fonts directory. But if you happen to change the
fonts, you will need to replace them in fonts/ and add your own fonts to
the templates.</p>
<h2 id="code-style">Code Style</h2>
<p>I don’t have one. I’m sorry.</p>
