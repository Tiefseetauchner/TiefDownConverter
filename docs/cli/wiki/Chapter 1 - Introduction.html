<p>Well, that’s a good question. Ask it later.</p>
<p>Jk, of course you may ask it now. TiefDown is a project format I made
up to make it easier to convert my files (mostly Markdown, but any type
works) into something pretty. As a matter of fact, this documentation is
managed by a TiefDown project!</p>
<p>The important thing is that this isn’t a markdown parser, replacement
or anything like that. It’s a project format, and it’s not even a
format, it’s pretty much just a manifest file and an executable.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I wonder myself every day. But alas, I should know, I wrote this
cluster**** so let me explain. The initial concept was born from pain
(as many are). I was pretty tired of exporting my files, then converting
them, overwriting my old files, then converting them again, overwriting
all history in the process. It was just… a mess.</p>
<p>So I did what any sane person would do: I learned Python.</p>
<p>Well, I’m being facetious. I didn’t “learn Python,” I just expanded
my capabilities to calling programs from the command line.</p>
<p>So my script, at first, just called Pandoc, then pdflatex, and then
pdflatex again for good measure. It created a PDF, overwriting my old
one. It was basically just converting a single markdown file into a PDF
with a basic TeX template (in my case, LiX Novel).</p>
<p>Then I realized that writing a 40-chapter story in a single markdown
file was even dumber than whatever I made in Python. So I added a little
combination logic. In the process, I had to write Lua filters as well,
and then I added versioning, and then I added conversion to multiple
different PDFs, and then I added EPUB support and-you know what? That
was a dumb idea. The Python script soon reached 200 lines of code, which
was untenable.</p>
<p>So yeah, I decided to make a new book. And of course -
<em><strong>everything</strong></em> broke. Instantly. I had to copy and
paste things, adjust my Python script, rewrote it a bit, and boom -
suddenly I had two different projects with different processes,
different outputs, different versions, different everything.</p>
<p>And then… I started a third book. Aaaand the Python script didn’t
really fulfill my needs, so I rewrote it in Bash. But worse.</p>
<p>I thought I had it all figured out. With Python. Then Bash. Then I
started a short story and lost my ******* mind.</p>
<h2 id="how-oh-wise-programmer-did-you-solve-this-problem">How, oh wise
programmer, did you solve this problem?</h2>
<p>I’m glad you asked! I’m glad. I… I hope you asked? Well, regardless
of whether or not you did, I’ll tell you.</p>
<p>I learned Rust.</p>
<p>For real this time, I learned a completely new programming language
just for this. But there was a reason, or a few rather:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I wanted cross-platform support.</li>
<li>I wanted a single executable.</li>
<li>I needed a language with good CLI support because, believe it or
not, I’m <em>awful</em> at GUIs.</li>
<li>I’m crazy.</li>
</ol>
<p>These reasons led me to two options: Python, a language I was
somewhat familiar with but didn’t particularly enjoy writing in, and
Rust, a language I had never written in before but was very interested
in.</p>
<p>Evidently, I chose Rust.</p>
<p>So I started: a CLI interface, command-line calls, and so on. Here’s
the rundown of how it works internally:</p>
<ul>
<li>You initialize a project with <code>tiefdownconverter init</code>.
This creates a few bits and bobs, but importantly the
<code>manifest.toml</code> file. This contains all the information
needed to actually manage and convert the project.</li>
<li>You can then manipulate the project, and so on.</li>
<li>When you add your files to the input directory, running
<code>tiefdownconverter convert</code> will do a few things. In order to
make it easy to understand, here’s an explanation I would understand
(had I not written it):
<ul>
<li>Take input files</li>
<li>Convert them</li>
<li>Convert them again (No one knows why)</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Isn’t that simple?</p>
<p>It isn’t. But oh well. We’ve got a lot of work to do on this, and if
you’re interested, don’t shy away from the <a
href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section!</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-point">So, what’s the point?</h2>
<p>Really? Making my life easier. I wanted to export my novel as a PDF
in A4, 8x5in, so on. If I can make your life easier as well, then I’m
the happiest woman alive.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>So where does TiefDownConverter actually come in handy? Well,
anywhere you need Markdown to turn into something nice without manually
fiddling with formats every time. Here are a few scenarios where it
saves the day:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing books</strong> - Really handy if you are already
writing in the likes of Markdown, and you really quickly need an a4 copy
for printing a proof copy, a 8x5 in copy because you print with a random
provider and a weird other format because you’re from the US and A4
paper hasn’t been invented there yet.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong> - I love looking at pretty
documentation, and writing it in Markdown simplifies my workflow
greatly. And once I’m done writing my documentation, I want it both as
an HTML and as a PDF, so people can print it and put it in the “never
read” shelf.<br />
Oh and I guess I could also print a book from it but eh eh eh, don’t
give me ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Blogging sites</strong> - No.</li>
<li><strong>Blogging sites pretty please?</strong> - Okay, maybe you
<em>could</em> use TDC to make a dynamic project that automatically
creates a blog for you. Maybe you <em>could</em> use CustomPreprocessors
conversion to create named files. Maybe you <em>could</em> set up
tooling around this. But you <em>shouldn’t</em>.<br />
Trust me. I tried. (For fun to be clear)</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, if your workflow involves Markdown and you’re sick of
manually converting everything, TiefDown is your new best friend.<br />
If you had a best friend in the first place, which, I don’t.</p>
